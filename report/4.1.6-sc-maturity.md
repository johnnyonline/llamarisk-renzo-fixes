**4.1.6 SC Maturity - https://hackmd.io/@PrismaRisk/ezETH#416-SC-Maturity**

**current version**

```
    Renzo deployed its smart contracts on December 5, 2023. Despite this significant step, the project has yet to embrace a formal versioning protocol for its smart contracts publicly, leading to challenges in distinguishing between the various iterations and updates of its codebase over time. While it's conceivable that Renzo adheres to versioning practices internally, the external visibility into the protocol's codebase evolution and documentation revisions is significantly hampered due to restricted repository access. This opacity is compounded by the absence of publicly available test suites or deployment guidelines.

    The protocol's audit history, comprising solely one private audit and devoid of public audit contests, leaves a gap in the visible trajectory of enhancements or rectifications made in response to audit findings. This scenario underscores a crucial aspect of smart contract development and maintenance that Renzo could further optimize to underscore its commitment to security and reliability.
