    - We rank ezETH poor in smart contracts due to a singular audit on its core system, with its cross-chain functionalities remaining unassessed. Additionally, the bug bounty program excludes the cross-chain system, and both the code life cycle and the testing suite - if it exists - are not publicly disclosed.
