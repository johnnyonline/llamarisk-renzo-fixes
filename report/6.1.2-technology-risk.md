    SMART CONTRACTS: Does the analysis of the audits and development activity suggest any cause for concern?

    A single audit was conducted over Renzo’s core contracts, uncovering multiple problems which were reportedly fixed. Critical centralization risks were overlooked, especially related to the control of funds. The audit's leniency with certain severe findings raises concerns about the thoroughness and efficacy of the process. The absence of wider public audit scrutiny particularly in cross-chain operations, highlights significant security exposure (although it excludes the cross-chain system from eligibility).

    Smart contract deployment began in December 2023 without a public versioning protocol, obscuring the evolution of its codebase. Public repository activities suggest limited external engagement and transparency, with key documentation and testing protocols absent. There is a bug bounty program with ImmuneFi, which offered a relatively low maximum payout for critical reports compared to the protocol size, but does contribute to security assurances for users.
