**4.1.2 Concerning Audit Signs - https://hackmd.io/@PrismaRisk/ezETH#412-Concerning-Audit-Signs**

**current version**

```
    Renzo's core contracts underwent a singular audit, which concluded with several issues, and the team reportedly rectified all identified findings. The public-facing code is presented as accessible and straightforward in its complexity, suggesting an initial layer of transparency and diligence.

    However, a glaring oversight in the audit is its omission of critical centralization vulnerabilities, notably the permissions allowing for arbitrary recipient specification during withdrawals from operators and the restaking of ETH accumulated in the DepositQueue. These mechanisms could, in effect, empower the Renzo team — or worse, an adversary who gains control over the multisig wallet — with the capacity to misappropriate user funds.

    The audit's Slither analysis revealed more findings than typically deemed acceptable, encompassing issues of high and medium severity. These were summarily dismissed as non-consequential or false positives by the auditing team. Notably, an approve call in the DepositQueue's sweepERC20 function, which facilitates the transfer of any accumulated ERC20 tokens to the RestakeManager, was flagged for not checking return values. This oversight could obstruct the claimability of ERC20 reward tokens by Renzo, particularly with tokens like USDT that do not implement a return call in their approve() function. A solution, such as employing OpenZeppelin's forceApprove function, could preempt such predicaments.

    A conspicuous absence of public audit competitions and a lack of comprehensive auditing for the cross-chain system further compound these concerns, leaving significant aspects of Renzo's security posture unvetted - at least within the public domain.

    Acknowledging the limitations of a singular private audit in uncovering the breadth of potential issues - as both historical precedent and this review's pointed observations suggest - it becomes evident that the current level of scrutiny may not suffice for a protocol entrusted with managing assets north of $2.2B (as of March 31th, 2024) in value. This situation underscores a pressing need for expanded and more rigorous audit efforts to ensure Renzo's resilience and reliability.

    Renzo's core contracts underwent a singular formal audit, which concluded with several issues, and the team reportedly rectified all identified findings. The public-facing code is presented as accessible and straightforward in its complexity, suggesting an initial layer of transparency and diligence. As described in section 4.1.1 (Protocol Audits) - In their recent Twitter post (https://x.com/RenzoProtocol/status/1793785619912827160), Renzo team mentions that HalbornSecurity has been finalizing a full re-audit of the protocol, and Sigma Prime was hired in April to complete an independent audit of the Renzo Protocol. It is still unclear whether the cross-chain system will be included in HalbornSecurity's re-audit or in Sigma Prime's independent audit. The Twitter post also mentions that a public audit competition was conducted recently, with the cross-chain system in the competition's scope.

    However, a glaring oversight in the singular public formal audit of HalbornSecurity is its omission of critical centralization vulnerabilities, notably the permissions allowing for arbitrary recipient specification during withdrawals from operators, the restaking of ETH accumulated in the DepositQueue, or the unchecked minting of ezETH - we provide a PoC for the latter, at the end of this section. These mechanisms could, in effect, empower the Renzo team — or worse, an adversary who gains control over the multisig wallet — with the capacity to misappropriate user funds.

    The audit's Slither analysis revealed more findings than typically deemed acceptable, encompassing issues of high and medium severity.

    TODO - add ezETH minting PoC
