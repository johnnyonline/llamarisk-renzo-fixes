```
    CENTRALIZATION: Are there any significant centralization vectors that could rug users?

    Renzo’s architecture exhibits pronounced centralization vectors that could potentially compromise user security and protocol integrity. The crux of the issue lies in the trifecta of centralized control aspects: the concentration of Validator operations, significant sway held by the development team, and reliance on a centralized wBETH price oracle. This amalgamation of centralization points forms a precarious foundation, where the protocol could be susceptible to manipulation or even user exploitation without necessitating changes to the existing contract implementations.

    While the decentralisation approach mirroring that of Lido seems practical at the outset, the lack of a publicly available strategy raises concerns about the commitment to diversification. A governance token is not yet introduced and details on future distribution mechanisms remain undisclosed.

    Renzo’s governance is controlled by a RoleManager contract managed by a 3/5 multisig wallet. The absence of timelock mechanisms exacerbates the centralization concerns and further amplifies the risk of compromised decision-making.

    Renzo’s governance is controlled by a RoleManager contract managed by a 3/5 multisig wallet. The presence of timelock mechanisms alleviates some of the centralization concerns regarding contract upgrades. However, the RoleManager contract, and as a result, the 3/5 multisig wallet, has the capacity to inappropriately misuse users funds, as demonstrated in section 4.1.2 (Concerning Audit Signs).
