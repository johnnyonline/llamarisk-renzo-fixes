**current version**

```
    Renzo's Ethereum mainnet contracts received a total of 1 audit:

    - Halborn (2023-11-29): 14 findings including 2 critical and 1 medium. All findings were resolved.

    No public audits are available for the cross-chain system, so we can only infer none were conducted.

    Renzo's Ethereum mainnet contracts received a total of 1 audit:

    - Halborn (2023-11-29): 14 findings including 2 critical and 1 medium. All findings were resolved.

    No public audits are available for the cross-chain system. However, in their recent Twitter post (https://x.com/RenzoProtocol/status/1793785619912827160), the team mentions that @HalbornSecurity (https://x.com/HalbornSecurity) has been on retainer, reviewing all contract upgrades, and is finalizing a full re-audit of the protocol. Additionally, the post mentions that @sigp_io (https://x.com/sigp_io) was hired in April to complete an independent re-audit of the Renzo Protocol - it is still unclear whether the cross-chain system will be included in this report.

    The Twitter post also mentions that a public audit competition was conducted via @code4rena (https://x.com/code4rena) recently, with over 50 Wardens reviewing the code. The cross-chain system was a part of the competition's scope.
