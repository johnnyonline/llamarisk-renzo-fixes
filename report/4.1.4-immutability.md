**4.1.4 Immutability - https://hackmd.io/@PrismaRisk/ezETH#414-Immutability**

**current version**

```
    The majority of Renzo's smart contracts possess pausability and upgradeability features, managed by a RoleManager contract (source code can be found here), which is controlled by a 3/5 multi-signature wallet. Upgradeability is facilitated through the Transparent Upgradeable Proxy pattern, noted to be less gas efficient relative to the UUPS proxy pattern, but more commonly used. Unlike the UUPS proxy pattern, where upgrade logic is housed in the implementation contracts, the transparent pattern integrates this logic within the proxy contracts, and checks if the caller is the owner on every call, which increases gas usage.

**updated version**

```
    The majority of Renzo's smart contracts possess pausability and upgradeability features, managed by a ProxyAdmin contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0x91625601e2BbBEb7171C40c79FadBCFbFf6A1982), that is owned by a timelock contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0x81F6e9914136Da1A1d3b1eFd14F7E0761c3d4cc7). Transactions can be proposed to the timelock contract by the addresses that are whitelisted under the PROPOSER_ROLE (https://etherscan.io/address/0x81F6e9914136Da1A1d3b1eFd14F7E0761c3d4cc7#readContract#F4), and executed by addresses that are whitelisted under the EXECUTOR_ROLE (https://etherscan.io/address/0x81F6e9914136Da1A1d3b1eFd14F7E0761c3d4cc7#readContract#F3).

    Currently, two addresses are whitelisted for proposing transactions - `0xAdef586efB3287Da4d7d1cbe15F12E0Be69e0DF0`, an EOA, and `0xD1e6626310fD54Eceb5b9a51dA2eC329D6D4B68A`, a 3/5 multisig. The 3/5 multisig is also whitelisted for executing transactions. The 3/5 multisig also has the TIMELOCK_ADMIN_ROLE, which has the ability to add or remove addresses from the aforementioned whitelists.  
 
    The presence of the OpenZeppelin's (https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts) `TimeLockController` contract, with a 3 day time lock, is set to protect all protocol upgrades, and give users a chance to exit the system in case of an upgrade they do not like. It is worth noting that a 3 day time lock is rather minimal, and since withdrawals are still not enabled, users may be required to exit the system at a loss.   

    Upgradeability is facilitated through the Transparent Upgradeable Proxy pattern, noted to be less gas efficient relative to the UUPS proxy pattern, but more commonly used. Unlike the UUPS proxy pattern, where upgrade logic is housed in the implementation contracts, the transparent pattern integrates this logic within the proxy contracts, and checks if the caller is the owner on every call, which increases gas usage.
